This is a Kivy project to for Graph Theory. This creates nodes and edges.
The nodes and edges can be added using the buttons. Nodes must be created first (atleast two).

Edges are created by selecting two nodes by double click.

Nodes move by drag and drop style movement. Edges adjust according to the movement of Nodes.

Once Node is created, it must be moved from the original position.
